folder-control
==============

This is a set of Perl scripts for file cataloguing, file backup,
synchronisation and file-level deduplication.

Sorry no documentation.

Pre-requisites from CPAN: JSON and DBD::SQLite.

Needed for some features: BSD::Resource, Email::MIME, IO::KQueue, Linux::Inotify, YAML.
